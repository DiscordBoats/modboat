# modboat
Simple moderation bot for Discord.

## Installation
1. ``git clone https://github.com/DiscordBoats/modboat.git && cd modboat``
2. ``npm i`` (or ``yarn``)
3. ``cd src && node setupdatabase.js``
4. ``mv config.json`` and fill out the config
4. ``npm start`` (or ``yarn start``)

## Future ideas
* Multi-guild support
* More database support
* Settings command instead of using config.json for everything
* Update to discord.js v13

## Credits
Special thanks to [August](https://github.com/auguwu) for helping me with the help command and message event that was originally used in another bot of mine.
